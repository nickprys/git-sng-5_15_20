Kindness in your eyes 
I guess you here me cry
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child

I blessed I know 
Heaven sent and heaven stole
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child

And what have I learned
From all this pain
I thought I'd never feel the same
About anyone
Or anything again
But now I know
When you find your love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights

When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight
Sadness
In my eyes
No one guessed
Or no one tried
You smiled at me
Like Jesus to a child
Loveless and cold
With your last breath
You saved my soul
You smiled at me
Like Jesus to a child
